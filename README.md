- [x] Changed command from /chestkits to /kit(Its up to my server standards!)
- [x] Make it so the items goes directly into the inventory rather than dropping onto the ground.(Not a great idea for reasons...)
- [ ] Make free kits rather than having a price counter display 0
- [ ] Add a cooldown to kits so you can buy unlimted amount of kits.
- [ ] Add your money balance to the UI.

Now I will not be releasing this version to poggit for obvious reasons. So if you want to keep updated than hit the star to save this respository.
